# Discrete-finite-state-Machine - Rust vs. C
The purpose of this implementation of a DFSM is to test the differences in implementing experience + performance of RUST and C. It was interesting for me as a study case to see how much easier / harder is to use RUST in implementing something as simple as a DFSM that accets the string "mihai". Some very basic error handling is implemented.
